Hello, I'm a 18-year-old hobbyist programmer from Hungary who likes making games. 
I also like to write scripts for whatever crazy idea comes to my mind, such as solving a word search puzzle, 
doing my grammar homework, or creating a program for my drone, so it attacks people by flying into their faces.
Have a look at them on my [website](https://aerolite.dev/).

## Tools & Languages

I used [GameMaker Studio 2](https://yoyogames.com) to code my games, 
but I switched to the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) which is free and open source. I highly recommend it. 
I publish my games to [itch.io](https://milanvarady.itch.io/) as well.

I write my scripts in [python](https://python.org/).
